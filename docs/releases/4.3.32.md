# TaskNotes 4.3.32 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

### Added
- **Per-task field overrides**: Custom frontmatter properties (e.g., `deadline`, `review_date`) can now replace core date fields (due, scheduled, completedDate, dateCreated) on a per-task basis
  - Tracking properties (`tnDueDateProp`, `tnScheduledDateProp`, etc.) written to task frontmatter
  - FieldMapper resolves overrides before falling back to global settings mapping
  - New utility: `fieldOverrideUtils.ts` for constants, read/write helpers
- **Expandable mapping rows**: Date-type custom properties in Edit Task and Bulk modals show expandable "Maps to" dropdown
  - Inline badge (e.g., "Due") visible at a glance when mapping is set
  - Conflict detection when both custom and default property exist

### Fixed
- **Bulk modal custom properties persistence**: Property rows no longer disappear when adding new properties. Root cause: active list was inside PropertyPicker's container (which calls `container.empty()` on refresh). Fixed by making active list a sibling in the parent section.
