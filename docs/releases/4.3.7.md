# 4.3.7

## Fixed

### isTask Checkbox Rendering (Dash/Prohibition Symbol)

Files converted by older versions may have `isTask: "true"` (string) instead of `isTask: true` (boolean). Obsidian Bases renders these as indeterminate checkboxes (dash or prohibition symbol).

**Fix**: The convert engine now auto-repairs type mismatches:
- Detects string `"true"` / `"false"` in frontmatter
- Converts to proper boolean on the next convert run
- Also handles `"yes"`, `"no"`, `"1"`, `"0"`

### BasesQueryWatcher Debug Logging

The notification system was "monitoring 0 bases" even when `.base` files had `notify: true`. Silent YAML parse errors made debugging impossible.

**Fix**: Added verbose logging:
- Logs parse results for each `.base` file
- Logs YAML errors with file path
- Helps identify why notifications aren't triggering

## How to Test

1. **isTask fix**: Run bulk convert on files with dash checkboxes, verify they now show checked
2. **BasesQueryWatcher**: Open dev console, look for `[BasesQueryWatcher]` logs showing which bases are monitored
