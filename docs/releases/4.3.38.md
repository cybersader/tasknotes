# TaskNotes 4.3.38 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

### Added
- **Per-base property mapping (ADR-011)**: Bases with custom column names (e.g., `deadline` instead of `due`, `owner` instead of `assignee`) can now configure `tnFieldMapping` in their YAML. Tasks created from these views automatically use the correct property names and get per-task tracking props (`tnDueDateProp`, `tnAssigneeProp`, etc.) so the system recognizes them.
- **Base identity system**: `BaseIdentityService` lazily generates `tnBaseId` and `tnViewId` UUIDs on `.base` files when TaskNotes features are configured. Enables provenance tracking and future migration tools.
- **"New task" button for native Table/Board views**: `BasesToolbarInjector` now injects a "New task" button alongside "Bulk tasking" on native Obsidian Bases views. Opens TaskCreationModal with the view's field mapping pre-populated.
- **PropertyPicker pre-population from view mapping**: When creating a task from a mapped view, Additional Properties shows the mapped fields (e.g., `deadline` with "Use as: Due date" badge) ready to fill in.
- **Click-to-edit for mapped date properties**: Mapped date fields show a read-only display that opens the full DateContextMenu (Today/Tomorrow/Pick date & time) on click, with two-way sync to the action bar calendar icons.
- **Assignee action bar icon**: New `user` icon in the task creation action bar. Clicking it (or clicking a mapped assignee property) expands the details section and scrolls to the PersonGroupPicker with search.
- **Tracking prop schema declarations**: Explicit field mappings via PropertyPicker always write tracking props (e.g., `tnDueDateProp: deadline`) even without values, declaring the task's property schema.

### Fixed
- **Tracking props no longer written without values** in the backend path (`TaskService.applyViewFieldMapping`, `BulkConvertEngine`). Only written when the task has an actual value for the mapped field.
- **Dual value conflict resolved**: When a standard field (Due Date picker) and a mapped property (`deadline`) both have values, the standard field redirects to the mapped property at save time instead of creating duplicates.
