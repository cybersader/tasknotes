# 4.3.9

## Fixed

### isTask Still Empty After Convert

The previous conditional logic was too complex and missed edge cases. Simplified to:

1. Delete the existing property (clear any problematic value)
2. Set fresh boolean `true`

No more conditions that can fail. The property is always written correctly.

## How to Test

1. Run bulk convert on files with empty `isTask:`
2. Verify frontmatter now shows `isTask: true`
3. Verify Bases checkbox renders as checked
