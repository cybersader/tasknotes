## Fixed

- (#768) Fixed calendar view appearing empty in week and day views due to invalid time configuration values
  - Added time validation in settings UI with proper error messages and debouncing
  - Prevents "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'years')" error from FullCalendar
  - Thanks to @userhandle for reporting and help debugging
```

-->

## Fixed

- Reduced long-running performance risk from calendar sync token persistence by avoiding full runtime settings side-effects during background sync writes
- Prevented duplicate auto-stop time tracking listeners from accumulating when settings are reloaded or changed
- Fixed a settings Integrations listener lifecycle issue that could accumulate calendar update callbacks while the settings UI is repeatedly opened/re-rendered
