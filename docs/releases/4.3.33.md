# TaskNotes 4.3.33 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

### Added
- **Universal Bases view support**: "Bulk tasking" button now appears on ALL Obsidian Bases views (Table, Board, etc.), not just TaskNotes-registered view types
  - New `BasesToolbarInjector` service detects any `.bases-toolbar` and injects the button
  - Native "New" button preserved on non-TaskNotes views (creates normal files as expected)
  - Automatic cleanup when switching between TaskNotes and non-TaskNotes view types
  - New setting: "Universal view buttons" in Features > Bases views section
- **CHANGELOG backfill**: Added real release notes for versions 4.3.24-4.3.32 (previously only had stubs)
- **CHANGELOG enforcement**: PostToolUse hook warns if CHANGELOG.md is missing an entry for the current version during commits/pushes
- **View Settings UX**: Added to roadmap as future enhancement

### Changed
- **PropertyPicker "mismatch" badge**: Renamed to "mixed type" with hover tooltip explaining which files have inconsistent property types and how to fix them
- **Edit Task modal PropertyPicker**: Search now appears above the property fields list (matching the bulk modal layout)

### Fixed
- **Toolbar buttons disappearing after view switch**: Buttons no longer vanish when switching Table → Task List → back to Table within the same .base file. Root cause: stale WeakSet caching prevented re-injection after Bases reused toolbar DOM elements.
