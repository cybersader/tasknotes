# TaskNotes 4.3.35 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

### Added
- **Edit existing reminders**: Pencil icon on each reminder card in the ReminderModal. Clicking it scrolls to the form, pre-populates all fields (type, offset, unit, direction, anchor, date/time, description), and switches to "Update Reminder" mode. Custom property anchors appear correctly selected in the "Relative to" dropdown. Editing card gets a visual highlight border. "Cancel edit" link returns to add mode.
- **Clickable timeline markers**: Timeline markers in the ReminderModal are now clickable — clicking a marker scrolls to and flash-highlights its corresponding reminder card (matching the settings timeline behavior).
- **Help icons across all modals**: Help-circle icons with descriptive tooltips on section headers in TaskEditModal (Properties & anchors, Completions, Task info), ReminderModal (Current Reminders, Add New Reminder), and the Properties & anchors settings section (Core, Global custom properties, Discovered & available group headers).
- **Task Properties overview callout**: New introductory callout at the top of Settings > Task Properties explaining the layered property system — global defaults here, per-task overrides via "Properties & anchors" in the Edit Task/Bulk Task modals, and reminder anchors in the Reminder modal.
- **Settings PropertyPicker non-date hint**: The property search in the settings Properties & anchors section now shows the same flash + inline hint behavior as the Reminder modal when clicking a non-date property, guiding users to convert first.
- **Auto-promote after conversion in settings**: After converting a non-date property to date via the "→ date" button in the settings PropertyPicker, the property is automatically promoted to a global custom property.

### Fixed
- **PropertyPicker dropdown not closing**: Removed broken `modal-container` count guard that always blocked close in stacked modal workflows (task edit + reminder modal = 2+ containers). Replaced `focus` listener with click toggle + 300ms debounce to prevent race conditions with Obsidian's focus management.
- **Type dropdown flash-close**: Native `<select>` option lists render outside the DOM tree, causing click-outside handlers to treat them as "outside". Added `HTMLSelectElement` active element guard in the PropertyPicker's outside-click handler.
- **Vault-wide checkbox persistence**: PropertyPicker "All tasks" checkbox state now persists across re-renders within the same ReminderModal session.
- **Non-date property click closing dropdown**: Clicking a non-date property in the PropertyPicker search triggered a blur event that closed the entire dropdown after 200ms. Added `dropdownClickedRecently` mousedown flag to prevent blur-close during dropdown interaction.
- **Raw property keys in "Relative to" dropdown**: Custom property anchors now show their raw frontmatter key (e.g., `follow_up`) instead of prettified display names (e.g., "Follow up") so users can identify the actual property name.

### Changed
- **PropertyPicker non-date hint**: Clicking a non-date property shows an inline hint with 4-second fade-out instead of a Notice, guiding users to use the conversion button. Applies to both modal and settings instances.
- **Auto-scroll after anchor selection**: Selecting a date property as anchor auto-scrolls to the "Relative to" dropdown in the Reminder modal.
