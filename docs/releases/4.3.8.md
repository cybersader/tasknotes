# 4.3.8

## Fixed

### isTask Empty Value Bug

When frontmatter had `isTask:` with no value (which YAML parses as `null`), the convert engine didn't repair it because it only checked for `undefined` and empty string.

**Before**: `isTask:` (empty) → stays empty
**After**: `isTask:` (empty) → becomes `isTask: true`

## How to Test

1. Run bulk convert on files that have `isTask:` (no value)
2. Verify frontmatter now shows `isTask: true`
3. Verify Bases checkbox renders as checked (not dash/prohibition symbol)
