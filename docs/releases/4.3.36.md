# TaskNotes 4.3.36 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

### Added
- **Availability window model**: Person notes now support `availableFrom` and `availableUntil` fields (replacing the single `reminderTime`). Day-or-longer reminders pin to the "available from" time. Sub-day reminders outside the window are deferred to the next available start time.
- **Night shift support**: Availability windows that wrap around midnight (e.g., 22:00-06:00) are handled correctly. Reminders outside the overnight window defer to the next shift start.
- **Override vs additive reminder mode**: New `overrideGlobalReminders` toggle on person notes. When enabled (default), personal lead-time reminders replace global rules. When disabled, both fire together with automatic deduplication of matching offsets.
- **Cross-reference links**: "Task Properties > Reminders" links to "Team & Attribution > Person preferences" and vice versa, making it easy to navigate between global and per-person reminder settings.

### Changed
- **"Personal global reminders" section**: Renamed from "Lead times" in the Team & Attribution settings for clarity.
- **"Add personal reminder" button**: Renamed from "Add lead time" to match the new section name.
- **Lead time display format**: Items now show "X before anchor" (e.g., "2 hours before anchor") instead of bare values.
- **Backwards-compatible migration**: Setting "Available from" automatically removes the legacy `reminderTime` field from person note frontmatter. Notes with only `reminderTime` still work via automatic fallback.
