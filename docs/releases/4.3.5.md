# TaskNotes 4.3.5 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

## Added

- Compatibility panel in Convert mode showing file type breakdown before conversion
  - Shows ready-to-convert, already-task, and non-markdown file counts
  - Expandable section listing incompatible filenames (max 5, then grouped overflow)
  - Warning banner when >25% of files will be skipped

## Fixed

- "What's New" page now shows fork release notes (was only showing upstream versions)
- Re-converting files with empty `isTask: ""` from buggy v4.3.3 now properly sets `isTask: true`
