# TaskNotes 4.3.43 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

### Added
- **PropertyPicker scope chips**: Replaced the single "Vault-wide" checkbox with context-aware scope chips: "This note", "View items", "All tasks", "All files". Chips appear based on available context — opening from a note defaults to "This note", from a Bases view defaults to "View items". Click any chip to switch discovery scope.
- **Context-aware task creation**: `Ctrl+P → Create new task` now auto-detects whether you're focused on a Bases view (passes view items) or a regular note (passes note path) for PropertyPicker discovery.
- **Folder right-click bulk tasking**: Right-click any folder in the file explorer to open "Bulk tasking (X files in folder)" — recursively collects all markdown files under the folder.
- **"Click to set..." pattern in Task Edit modal**: Mapped properties (date fields, assignee fields) in the Edit Task modal now show interactive "Click to set..." placeholders. Clicking opens the date picker or scrolls to the assignee picker, matching the New Task modal behavior.

### Changed
- **File explorer "Bulk tasking" label**: Renamed from "Bulk convert to tasks (X files)" to "Bulk tasking (X files)" — the default tab is controlled by the `defaultBulkMode` setting.
- **"Base view defaults & settings" tab hidden without context**: The view settings tab in BulkTaskCreationModal is now hidden when opened from the file explorer (no base file context), since it has no meaning outside a Bases view.

### Fixed
- **PropertyPicker empty fallback**: When no context is available, PropertyPicker defaults to "All tasks" scope instead of showing empty results.
