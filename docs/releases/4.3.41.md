# TaskNotes 4.3.41 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

### Fixed
- **View mappings now pre-populate Generate/Convert PropertyPicker**: Field mappings configured in "Base view settings" (e.g., `deadline` → Due date) now appear as active property rows with "Use as" badges when opening the Generate or Convert tabs. Previously, mappings were only passed to engines at execution time but not shown in the UI.
- **View default properties pre-loaded into bulk workflows**: Default property values configured per-view in the .base YAML are now loaded into the Generate/Convert custom properties section, so users can see and adjust them before execution.
