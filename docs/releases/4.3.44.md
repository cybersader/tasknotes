# TaskNotes 4.3.44 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

### Added
- **Settings migration on change**: Changing any logic-controlling setting (person/group type values, task tag, task property name/value, identity type property name, creator/assignee field names) now shows a confirmation modal: "X notes affected. Migrate all / Change without migrating / Cancel". Prevents silently disconnecting existing notes when renaming frontmatter properties or values.
- **"Migrate frontmatter properties" command**: New command palette action (`Ctrl+P → Migrate frontmatter properties`) for on-demand property key renames, value changes, and tag renames across your vault. Shows live count of affected files, supports folder scoping with autocomplete.

### Fixed
- **View defaults propagation**: Saving defaults in "Base view defaults & settings" tab now immediately reflects in Generate/Convert tabs without requiring modal close/reopen.
- **Card header immediate update**: Changing property names (type, creator, assignee, note UUID, custom fields) now instantly updates the card header subtitle instead of requiring settings reopen.
- **Migration fires on blur, not per keystroke**: Person/group type values and other migration-wired text inputs now trigger the migration confirmation only when you click outside the field, not on every character typed.
- **"Open upcoming view" command name**: Fixed raw i18n key showing as `commands.openUpcomingView` in the command palette instead of the friendly name.
