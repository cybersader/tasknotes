# TaskNotes 4.3.14 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

### Added
- **Upcoming View** (`tasknotesUpcoming`): New Todoist-style Bases view type for aggregated task display
  - Time-categorized sections: Overdue, Today, Tomorrow, This Week, This Month, Later, No Due Date
  - Agenda-style date navigation bar with period selectors (Year, Month, Week, 3-Day, Day, List)
  - Arrow navigation (< >) and "Today" quick-jump button
  - Collapsible sections with item counts
  - "Add task" button at bottom of each section (creates task with correct due date)
  - Reschedule action in section headers
- **Base Notification Sync Service**: Real TaskNote files for notification-enabled bases
  - Creates task files with `type: base-notification` for bases with `notify: true`
  - Fully compatible with Bases filtering (sync-to-files approach)
  - Auto-sync on plugin load, periodic checks, and manual command
  - Configurable behavior when base has no matching items
- **Base notification rendering in Upcoming view**:
  - Bell icon indicator for base notification tasks
  - Right-side accent border for visual distinction
  - Item count badge (e.g., "11" with layers icon)
  - Specialized context menu: Open base, Open task, Mark resolved, Reschedule, Snooze
- **Time display** (Todoist-style): Clock icon with formatted time for tasks with time component
- **Date row color coding**: Overdue (red), Today (green), Tomorrow (orange), This Week/Month (accent), Later (muted)

### Fixed
- **Date categorization timezone bug**: Tasks due "today" were incorrectly showing as "overdue" in negative UTC offset timezones. Root cause: `new Date("YYYY-MM-DD")` parses as UTC midnight. Fixed by using `parseDateAsLocal()` for timezone-safe local date parsing.
- **Add task date bug**: Creating task for "Tomorrow" created it on wrong day due to `toISOString()` UTC conversion. Fixed by using local date components directly.
- **Hover jitter on base notification items**: Conflicting CSS hover styles caused layout shifts. Fixed with consistent padding/margin in hover state.

### Changed
- **Overdue display**: Removed redundant "Due" prefix (e.g., "Yesterday" instead of "Due yesterday") since items are already in red Overdue section
- **Add task button indent**: Subtle 4px indent to align with task content (reduced from 26px)
- **Base notification accent**: Changed from bright purple to subtle `--text-accent` color
