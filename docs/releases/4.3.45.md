# TaskNotes 4.3.45 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

### Added
- **Creator/Assignee fallback PersonGroupPicker**: Creator and Assignee fields now always render with PersonGroupPicker in Create/Edit task modals, even when user fields aren't explicitly configured. Uses per-field-key Map storage to prevent race conditions between multiple pickers.
- **Mapped property "Click to set..." in bulk modal**: Generate/Convert property rows mapped to core fields now use rich editors instead of plain inputs — date-mapped properties open DateContextMenu (calendar popup), assignee-mapped properties scroll to and highlight the ASSIGNEES section.
- **Bidirectional value sync**: Setting a date via the action bar icon syncs to the mapped property row, and vice versa. Both directions stay in sync.
- **Centralized field editor config**: New `OVERRIDABLE_FIELD_EDITORS` and `OVERRIDABLE_FIELD_PICKER_TITLES` in `fieldOverrideUtils.ts` — adding new "Map to" fields requires only config entries, no scattered if-checks.
- **Upstream discussion draft**: Added design discussion points for task modal layout (listed sections vs icon-only actions) and bulk modal assignees consolidation.

### Changed
- **Base View Defaults**: Mapped properties now show read-only "set via task field" label instead of editable value inputs, since default values are future work.
- **Helptip messaging**: Properties & Anchors helptips in Create Task, Edit Task, and Bulk modals now mention the "Map to" feature for mapping custom properties to standard task fields.

### Fixed
- **Creator/Assignee picker race condition**: Fixed shared `assigneePicker` reference causing async group discovery to destroy the wrong picker when both Creator and Assignee are rendered. Now uses per-field-key Map with `data-field-key` targeted DOM lookup.
- **Creator section separator styling**: Fixed triple/double line separators between Assignee and Creator sections — now shows clean single-line separation.
