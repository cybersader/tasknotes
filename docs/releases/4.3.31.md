# TaskNotes 4.3.31 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

### Changed
- **Safe hide button**: "x" remove button on custom properties changed to eye-off "Hide" button that only hides the property from the modal view, does NOT delete from frontmatter
- **Consistent naming**: Renamed "Additional properties" to "Custom properties" across Edit Task modal to match bulk modal terminology
