# TaskNotes 4.3.19 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

### Added
- **Per-device notification preferences**: Each device can override vault-wide notification settings
  - Notification type (in-app, system, both) per device
  - Scope filtering (by assignment) per device
  - Uses localStorage — never syncs across devices
- **"Both" notification delivery**: New option sends both in-app toast and system notification
- **Toast snooze dropdown**: Snooze all notifications with 4 duration options (15m, 1h, 4h, until tomorrow)
- **Toast overdue highlighting**: Overdue count shown in red in toast subtitle
- **Test notification button**: Send test in-app/system/both notifications from settings
- **Notification troubleshooting**: Collapsible guide for system notification issues (Windows Electron limitation)
- **Settings cross-links**: Navigate between Features and Team & Attribution notification sections

### Changed
- **Actionable toasts persist**: Toasts with action buttons no longer auto-dismiss (WCAG 2.2.4 compliance)
- **Toast dismiss button**: Now shows text "Dismiss" instead of icon (better visibility in dark themes)
- **Realistic test notification**: Shows aggregated toast with snooze instead of simple message
- **Shared assignee filter**: NotificationService and VaultWideNotificationService use common filtering logic

### Fixed
- **NotificationService device prefs**: Now reads notification type from per-device preferences instead of vault-wide only
- **"Both" permission request**: System notification permission requested for "both" delivery type
