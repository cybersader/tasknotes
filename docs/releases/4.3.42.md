# TaskNotes 4.3.42 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

### Changed
- **Configure view panel simplified**: Removed "Notify when" dropdown and threshold slider from the compact popup to avoid Obsidian layout clipping issues. The panel now shows three clean rows: show toolbar toggle, notify toggle, and a "View defaults & settings" link.
- **"View defaults & settings" link**: Renamed from "Default properties & anchors" with a descriptive hint ("Notifications, property mappings, defaults") to clearly communicate what's accessible in the full settings modal.
- **Tab renamed**: "Base view settings" tab in BulkTaskCreationModal renamed to "Base view defaults & settings" for clarity.

### Fixed
- **Configure view panel overflow**: Resolved popup clipping and grey-screen issues caused by injected controls exceeding Obsidian's fixed-height popup container. Detailed notification config now lives exclusively in the full modal.
- **View mappings pre-populate Generate/Convert PropertyPicker**: Field mappings configured in view settings now appear as active property rows with "Use as" badges when opening Generate or Convert tabs.
- **View default properties pre-loaded**: Default property values from the .base YAML are loaded into Generate/Convert custom properties on modal open.
