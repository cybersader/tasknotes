# TaskNotes 4.3.34 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*


### Added
- **Reminder timeline preview**: Live-updating horizontal timeline in Settings > Task Properties > Reminders showing all configured reminders relative to the anchor date
  - Default reminders shown above the line (blue), global reminders below (orange)
  - Human-readable offset labels ("1 day before", "3 hours after") instead of raw descriptions
  - Time scale ticks with adaptive intervals ("1 day", "1 week", "1 month", "1 year")
  - **Time jump breaks**: When reminders span vastly different scales (e.g., 1 day + 6 months), the timeline inserts a `⋯` break instead of squishing markers together
  - **Click-to-scroll**: Click any timeline marker to scroll to and highlight its configuration card
  - **Label collision avoidance**: Overlapping labels automatically nudge apart
- **Global reminder rules**: Virtual reminders evaluated at runtime for all tasks with matching dates (lead-time, due-date persistent, overdue repeating, start-date)
  - Configurable in Settings > Task Properties > Reminders > Global Reminders
  - `skipIfExplicitExists` option to defer to task-specific reminders
  - Three preset rules (all disabled by default): 1-day lead time, persistent due-date, daily overdue
- **Semantic type presets** in ReminderModal: Quick-add buttons for common reminder patterns
- **Visual separation**: Default and Global reminder sections have distinct accent borders (blue/orange) for clear hierarchy
- **Help text and cross-links**: Descriptions, semantic type explanations, and navigation links between Features and Task Properties tabs

### Changed
- **Reminder "Relative to" dropdown**: Now groups anchors by origin (core fields, custom mapped, discovered) with section headers
- **ReminderModal clarity**: Improved field labels and descriptions for offset, direction, and anchor selection
