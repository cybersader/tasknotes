# TaskNotes 4.3.6 (Fork)

*This release is from the [cybersader/tasknotes](https://github.com/cybersader/tasknotes) fork.*

## Fixed

- **isTask detection bug**: `TaskManager.isTaskFile()` rejected empty `taskPropertyValue` setting, so converted files with `isTask: true` were never recognized as tasks. Guard clause now treats empty value as "property existence check" (any truthy value matches).
- **Task creation with empty propValue**: `TaskService` now defaults to `isTask: true` (boolean) when `taskPropertyValue` setting is empty, matching the convert engine's behavior.
