## Bases Integration

TaskNotes v4 uses Obsidian's Bases core plugin for its main views. For setup instructions, see [Core Concepts](../core-concepts.md#bases-integration).

### View Commands Configuration

View command settings map TaskNotes commands and ribbon actions to specific `.base` files. This is useful when you maintain custom variants of the default views and want first-class command access to those files.

Access these settings in **Settings → TaskNotes → General → View Commands**.

Default mappings:

- **Open Mini Calendar View** → `TaskNotes/Views/mini-calendar-default.base`
- **Open Kanban View** → `TaskNotes/Views/kanban-default.base`
- **Open Tasks View** → `TaskNotes/Views/tasks-default.base`
- **Open Calendar View** → `TaskNotes/Views/calendar-default.base`
- **Open Agenda View** → `TaskNotes/Views/agenda-default.base`
- **Relationships Widget** → `TaskNotes/Views/relationships.base`

Each command allows you to specify a custom `.base` file path and includes a reset button to restore the default path.

**Create Default Files**: Button to generate all default `.base` files in the `TaskNotes/Views/` directory. Existing files are not overwritten.

## OAuth Calendar Integration

Connect Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook to sync events bidirectionally with TaskNotes. Events automatically refresh every 15 minutes and sync when local changes are made (such as dragging events to reschedule).

### Setup Requirements

OAuth integration requires creating your own OAuth application with Google and/or Microsoft. Initial setup takes approximately 15 minutes per provider.

**Setup Guide**: See [Calendar Integration Setup](../calendar-setup.md) for detailed instructions on creating OAuth credentials with Google Cloud Console and Azure Portal.

### Google Calendar

Provide **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Google Cloud Console, then use **Connect Google Calendar** to complete OAuth loopback authentication. **Disconnect** revokes local credentials.

When connected, displays:
- Connected account email
- Connection time
- Last sync time
- Manual refresh button

### Microsoft Outlook Calendar

Provide **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Azure App Registration, then use **Connect Microsoft Calendar** to authenticate. **Disconnect** removes stored credentials and sync access.

When connected, displays:
- Connected account email
- Connection time
- Last sync time

### Security

- OAuth credentials are stored locally in Obsidian's data folder
- Access tokens refresh automatically
- Calendar data syncs directly between Obsidian and the calendar provider (no intermediary servers)
- Disconnect at any time to revoke access

## Calendar subscriptions (ICS)

ICS settings define how subscribed calendar events are represented in your vault. You can set a default template, destination folder, filename strategy, and custom filename template for generated notes. Use **Add Calendar Subscription** to register URLs or local files, and **Refresh all subscriptions** for manual synchronization.

## Automatic ICS export

Automatic export keeps an ICS feed of your tasks updated on a schedule. Configure whether it is enabled, where the file is written (vault-relative path), the refresh interval, and use **Export now** for immediate output.

## HTTP API

HTTP API settings control the local server lifecycle, listening port, and request authentication token.

Changes to API enablement or port require an Obsidian restart to take effect.

!!! warning
    If the authentication token is empty, API requests are unauthenticated. Set a token unless your environment is fully trusted.

## Webhooks

- **Add Webhook**: Register a new webhook endpoint.
