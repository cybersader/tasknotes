# Features

TaskNotes covers the full spectrum of task management, from basic organization to advanced workflows with time tracking and calendar integration.

## Task Management

TaskNotes gives each task a structured set of properties, including status, priority, due and scheduled dates, tags, contexts, and optional estimates. Because these values live in frontmatter, they stay readable and portable while still powering advanced filtering and grouping in Bases.

Reminders can be relative (for example, "3 days before due") or absolute, and completed tasks can be archived automatically to keep active work surfaces focused.

See [Task Management](features/task-management.md) for details.
For recurrence behavior, see [Recurring Tasks](features/recurring-tasks.md).
For reminder setup and data format, see [Task Reminders](features/reminders.md).

## Filtering and Views

TaskNotes uses Obsidian's Bases engine for filtering, sorting, and grouping. Each view is a `.base` file, so you can inspect or edit its query logic directly instead of relying on hidden plugin state.

This design also makes view customization practical: you can duplicate a default view, tweak grouping or formulas, and keep both versions side by side in your vault.

For details on how Bases integration works, see [Core Concepts](core-concepts.md#bases-integration). For Bases syntax documentation, see the [official Obsidian Bases documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Bases/Introduction+to+Bases).

## Inline Task Integration

Inline task features let you work from normal notes without context switching. Task links can display interactive cards, checkboxes can be converted into full task notes, and project notes can surface subtasks and dependency relationships in place.

Natural language parsing supports date, priority, and context extraction across multiple languages, which helps keep capture friction low while preserving structured data.

See [Inline Task Integration](features/inline-tasks.md) for details.

## Time Management

Time tracking records work sessions per task, and Pomodoro mode supports focused intervals with break handling. Over time, the statistics views help you compare estimated versus actual effort and spot trends in workload distribution.

## Calendar Integration

TaskNotes supports bidirectional OAuth sync with Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook, plus read-only ICS subscriptions for external feeds. Calendar views include month, week, day, year, and list modes, and drag-and-drop scheduling can update tasks directly.

For planning workflows, time-blocking and calendar-linked task updates make it possible to move from backlog management to real schedule execution in one workspace.

See [Calendar Integration](features/calendar-integration.md) for details.

## User Fields

User fields let you extend the core model with vault-specific metadata like client, energy level, billing code, or review state. Once added, these fields become available in filters, sorting, templates, and formulas.

See [User Fields](features/user-fields.md) for details.

## Integrations

Beyond calendar sync, TaskNotes includes an HTTP API and webhook support for automation workflows, external dashboards, or custom tooling.

See [Integrations](settings/integrations.md) for details.

## REST API

External applications can interact with TaskNotes through its REST API for automation, reporting, and integration with other tools.

See [HTTP API](HTTP_API.md) for details.
