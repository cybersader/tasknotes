# Changelog

All notable changes to this TaskNotes fork will be documented in this file.

This fork (`cybersader/tasknotes`) adds bulk tasking, notifications, and other enhancements to the upstream [TaskNotes](https://github.com/callumalpass/tasknotes) plugin.

## [4.3.40] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Consolidated Configure view panel**: All view types (native Table/Board/Cards and TaskNotes Task List/Kanban/Calendar/etc.) now show an identical branded TaskNotes section in the Configure view panel with show toolbar toggle, notification toggle, "Notify when" dropdown, threshold slider, and "Default properties & anchors" link.
- **"Notify when" dropdown for native views**: Native Bases views now have the full notification control set (any results match, new items appear, count exceeds threshold) that was previously only available on TaskNotes-registered views.

### Fixed
- **"Open Configure view panel" link**: Clicking the link in BulkTaskCreationModal now reliably closes the modal, opens the popup, and navigates directly to the Configure view sub-panel using polling-based waits and chevron click detection.
- **"Show toolbar buttons" toggle**: Now provides immediate DOM feedback (buttons appear/disappear instantly) and correctly handles toolbars that were already injected.
- **"Global setting" link**: Now navigates to the plugin's Features settings tab and scrolls to the "Bases views" heading.
- **Duplicate TaskNotes sections**: Fixed race condition where switching view types in the Layout dropdown could produce duplicate branded sections in the Configure panel.

## [4.3.39] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- **PersonGroupPicker dropdown stays open on collapse**: The assignee search dropdown (appended to `document.body`) now closes when the task creation modal collapses via the chevron button.
- **Assignee icon shows "has-value" dot**: Selecting a person or group in the PersonGroupPicker now immediately updates the assignee action bar icon with the purple indicator dot.

## [4.3.38] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Per-base property mapping (ADR-011)**: Bases with custom column names (e.g., `deadline` instead of `due`, `owner` instead of `assignee`) can now configure `tnFieldMapping` in their YAML. Tasks created from these views automatically use the correct property names and get per-task tracking props (`tnDueDateProp`, `tnAssigneeProp`, etc.) so the system recognizes them.
- **Base identity system**: `BaseIdentityService` lazily generates `tnBaseId` and `tnViewId` UUIDs on `.base` files when TaskNotes features are configured. Enables provenance tracking and future migration tools.
- **"New task" button for native Table/Board views**: `BasesToolbarInjector` now injects a "New task" button alongside "Bulk tasking" on native Obsidian Bases views. Opens TaskCreationModal with the view's field mapping pre-populated.
- **PropertyPicker pre-population from view mapping**: When creating a task from a mapped view, Additional Properties shows the mapped fields (e.g., `deadline` with "Use as: Due date" badge) ready to fill in.
- **Click-to-edit for mapped date properties**: Mapped date fields show a read-only display that opens the full DateContextMenu (Today/Tomorrow/Pick date & time) on click, with two-way sync to the action bar calendar icons.
- **Assignee action bar icon**: New `user` icon in the task creation action bar. Clicking it (or clicking a mapped assignee property) expands the details section and scrolls to the PersonGroupPicker with search.
- **Tracking prop schema declarations**: Explicit field mappings via PropertyPicker always write tracking props (e.g., `tnDueDateProp: deadline`) even without values, declaring the task's property schema.

### Fixed
- **Tracking props no longer written without values** in the backend path (`TaskService.applyViewFieldMapping`, `BulkConvertEngine`). Only written when the task has an actual value for the mapped field.
- **Dual value conflict resolved**: When a standard field (Due Date picker) and a mapped property (`deadline`) both have values, the standard field redirects to the mapped property at save time instead of creating duplicates.

## [4.3.37] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- **Bulk tasking button shows correct item count**: The "Bulk tasking" modal now shows only the items visible in the current view, matching the view's filter count. Previously it pulled all raw query results (e.g., 137 items when only 10 were visible).
- **Native Table/Board views**: Fixed the toolbar injector to read filtered results from `view.controller.results` directly, instead of falling back to parsing the `.base` file which returned unfiltered results.
- **TaskNotes custom views**: TaskListView, KanbanView, CalendarView, and UpcomingView now cache filtered items after `applySearchFilter()` so the bulk modal receives the same filtered set the user sees.
- **UpcomingView crash on view switch**: Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')" error that flashed briefly when switching view types, caused by `extractDataItems()` being called before data was available.

## [4.3.36] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Availability window model**: Person notes now support `availableFrom` and `availableUntil` fields (replacing the single `reminderTime`). Day-or-longer reminders pin to the "available from" time. Sub-day reminders outside the window are deferred to the next available start time.
- **Night shift support**: Availability windows that wrap around midnight (e.g., 22:00-06:00) are handled correctly. Reminders outside the overnight window defer to the next shift start.
- **Override vs additive reminder mode**: New `overrideGlobalReminders` toggle on person notes. When enabled (default), personal lead-time reminders replace global rules. When disabled, both fire together with automatic deduplication of matching offsets.
- **Cross-reference links**: "Task Properties > Reminders" links to "Team & Attribution > Person preferences" and vice versa, making it easy to navigate between global and per-person reminder settings.

### Changed
- **"Personal global reminders" section**: Renamed from "Lead times" in the Team & Attribution settings for clarity.
- **"Add personal reminder" button**: Renamed from "Add lead time" to match the new section name.
- **Lead time display format**: Items now show "X before anchor" (e.g., "2 hours before anchor") instead of bare values.
- **Backwards-compatible migration**: Setting "Available from" automatically removes the legacy `reminderTime` field from person note frontmatter. Notes with only `reminderTime` still work via automatic fallback.

## [4.3.35] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Edit existing reminders**: Pencil icon on each reminder card in the ReminderModal. Clicking it scrolls to the form, pre-populates all fields (type, offset, unit, direction, anchor, date/time, description), and switches to "Update Reminder" mode. Custom property anchors appear correctly selected in the "Relative to" dropdown. Editing card gets a visual highlight border. "Cancel edit" link returns to add mode.
- **Clickable timeline markers**: Timeline markers in the ReminderModal are now clickable — clicking a marker scrolls to and flash-highlights its corresponding reminder card (matching the settings timeline behavior).
- **Help icons across all modals**: Help-circle icons with descriptive tooltips on section headers in TaskEditModal (Properties & anchors, Completions, Task info), ReminderModal (Current Reminders, Add New Reminder), and the Properties & anchors settings section (Core, Global custom properties, Discovered & available group headers).
- **Task Properties overview callout**: New introductory callout at the top of Settings > Task Properties explaining the layered property system — global defaults here, per-task overrides via "Properties & anchors" in the Edit Task/Bulk Task modals, and reminder anchors in the Reminder modal.
- **Settings PropertyPicker non-date hint**: The property search in the settings Properties & anchors section now shows the same flash + inline hint behavior as the Reminder modal when clicking a non-date property, guiding users to convert first.
- **Auto-promote after conversion in settings**: After converting a non-date property to date via the "→ date" button in the settings PropertyPicker, the property is automatically promoted to a global custom property.

### Fixed
- **PropertyPicker dropdown not closing**: Removed broken `modal-container` count guard that always blocked close in stacked modal workflows (task edit + reminder modal = 2+ containers). Replaced `focus` listener with click toggle + 300ms debounce to prevent race conditions with Obsidian's focus management.
- **Type dropdown flash-close**: Native `<select>` option lists render outside the DOM tree, causing click-outside handlers to treat them as "outside". Added `HTMLSelectElement` active element guard in the PropertyPicker's outside-click handler.
- **Vault-wide checkbox persistence**: PropertyPicker "All tasks" checkbox state now persists across re-renders within the same ReminderModal session.
- **Non-date property click closing dropdown**: Clicking a non-date property in the PropertyPicker search triggered a blur event that closed the entire dropdown after 200ms. Added `dropdownClickedRecently` mousedown flag to prevent blur-close during dropdown interaction.
- **Raw property keys in "Relative to" dropdown**: Custom property anchors now show their raw frontmatter key (e.g., `follow_up`) instead of prettified display names (e.g., "Follow up") so users can identify the actual property name.

### Changed
- **PropertyPicker non-date hint**: Clicking a non-date property shows an inline hint with 4-second fade-out instead of a Notice, guiding users to use the conversion button. Applies to both modal and settings instances.
- **Auto-scroll after anchor selection**: Selecting a date property as anchor auto-scrolls to the "Relative to" dropdown in the Reminder modal.

## [4.3.34] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Reminder timeline preview**: Live-updating horizontal timeline in Settings > Task Properties > Reminders showing all configured reminders relative to the anchor date
  - Default reminders shown above the line (blue), global reminders below (orange)
  - Human-readable offset labels ("1 day before", "3 hours after") instead of raw descriptions
  - Time scale ticks with adaptive intervals ("1 day", "1 week", "1 month", "1 year")
  - **Time jump breaks**: When reminders span vastly different scales (e.g., 1 day + 6 months), the timeline inserts a `⋯` break instead of squishing markers together
  - **Click-to-scroll**: Click any timeline marker to scroll to and highlight its configuration card
  - **Label collision avoidance**: Overlapping labels automatically nudge apart
- **Global reminder rules**: Virtual reminders evaluated at runtime for all tasks with matching dates (lead-time, due-date persistent, overdue repeating, start-date)
  - Configurable in Settings > Task Properties > Reminders > Global Reminders
  - `skipIfExplicitExists` option to defer to task-specific reminders
  - Three preset rules (all disabled by default): 1-day lead time, persistent due-date, daily overdue
- **Semantic type presets** in ReminderModal: Quick-add buttons for common reminder patterns
- **Visual separation**: Default and Global reminder sections have distinct accent borders (blue/orange) for clear hierarchy
- **Help text and cross-links**: Descriptions, semantic type explanations, and navigation links between Features and Task Properties tabs

### Changed
- **Reminder "Relative to" dropdown**: Now groups anchors by origin (core fields, custom mapped, discovered) with section headers
- **ReminderModal clarity**: Improved field labels and descriptions for offset, direction, and anchor selection

## [4.3.33] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Universal Bases view support**: "Bulk tasking" button now appears on ALL Obsidian Bases views (Table, Board, etc.), not just TaskNotes-registered view types
  - New `BasesToolbarInjector` service detects any `.bases-toolbar` and injects the button
  - Native "New" button preserved on non-TaskNotes views (creates normal files as expected)
  - Automatic cleanup when switching between TaskNotes and non-TaskNotes view types
  - New setting: "Universal view buttons" in Features > Bases views section
- **CHANGELOG backfill**: Added real release notes for versions 4.3.24-4.3.32 (previously only had stubs)
- **CHANGELOG enforcement**: PostToolUse hook warns if CHANGELOG.md is missing an entry for the current version during commits/pushes
- **View Settings UX**: Added to roadmap as future enhancement

### Changed
- **PropertyPicker "mismatch" badge**: Renamed to "mixed type" with hover tooltip explaining which files have inconsistent property types and how to fix them
- **Edit Task modal PropertyPicker**: Search now appears above the property fields list (matching the bulk modal layout)

### Fixed
- **Toolbar buttons disappearing after view switch**: Buttons no longer vanish when switching Table → Task List → back to Table within the same .base file. Root cause: stale WeakSet caching prevented re-injection after Bases reused toolbar DOM elements.

## [4.3.32] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Per-task field overrides**: Custom frontmatter properties (e.g., `deadline`, `review_date`) can now replace core date fields (due, scheduled, completedDate, dateCreated) on a per-task basis
  - Tracking properties (`tnDueDateProp`, `tnScheduledDateProp`, etc.) written to task frontmatter
  - FieldMapper resolves overrides before falling back to global settings mapping
  - New utility: `fieldOverrideUtils.ts` for constants, read/write helpers
- **Expandable mapping rows**: Date-type custom properties in Edit Task and Bulk modals show expandable "Maps to" dropdown
  - Inline badge (e.g., "Due") visible at a glance when mapping is set
  - Conflict detection when both custom and default property exist

### Fixed
- **Bulk modal custom properties persistence**: Property rows no longer disappear when adding new properties. Root cause: active list was inside PropertyPicker's container (which calls `container.empty()` on refresh). Fixed by making active list a sibling in the parent section.

## [4.3.31] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- **Safe hide button**: "x" remove button on custom properties changed to eye-off "Hide" button that only hides the property from the modal view, does NOT delete from frontmatter
- **Consistent naming**: Renamed "Additional properties" to "Custom properties" across Edit Task modal to match bulk modal terminology

## [4.3.30] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Custom properties in Reminder "Relative to" dropdown**: Pass task path and userFields as customProperties to ReminderContextMenu so `getAvailableDateAnchors()` can discover custom date properties
- Added `getTaskPath()` override pattern for TaskEditModal

## [4.3.29] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Search input padding override**: Added inline style + `!important` to ensure PropertyPicker search input padding-left isn't overridden by Obsidian's built-in input styles (CSS specificity issue)

## [4.3.28] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Reminder origin indicators**: "Relative to" dropdown groups anchors by origin (Core / User fields / Discovered)
  - `DateAnchor` interface gains `origin` field for tracking property source
- **Scroll affordance gradient**: Bottom fade gradient on bulk modal body

### Changed
- CUSTOM PROPERTIES separated into its own section with proper spacing from BULK VALUES
- Search input padding refined (34px + box-sizing)
- Custom Properties help text expanded with examples

## [4.3.27] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **isTask in Additional Properties**: Excluded `isTask`/`identityType` properties from Additional Properties (buildSkipKeys now includes taskPropertyName + identityTypePropertyName)
- **Search input overlap**: Increased padding and vertically centered magnifying glass icon in PropertyPicker

### Changed
- Replaced confusing braces icon with CUSTOM PROPERTIES section heading + help tooltip in bulk modal
- Renamed "All tasks" to "Vault-wide" with tooltip explaining scope

## [4.3.26] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Duplicate date anchors**: Skip FieldMapper-mapped frontmatter names in date anchor discovery (prevents duplicate "Due date" when internal "due" maps to "due_date")
- **Bulk modal braces icon**: Added missing icon to `renderActionBarInto()` (appeared after mode switch)
- **Additional Properties styling**: Added separator + uppercase label for cleaner section appearance

### Added
- `buildSkipKeys()` shared helper for consistent property exclusion across modules

## [4.3.25] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **PropertyPicker auto-discovery**: Custom frontmatter properties in Edit Task, Task Creation, and Bulk modals without manual settings registration
  - Searchable PropertyPicker UI with type-ahead filtering
  - Type detection (text, number, date, boolean, list) from existing frontmatter values
  - Vault-wide scanning for property discovery across task files
  - Type conversion when adding properties to tasks
  - New utility: `propertyDiscoveryUtils.ts` for centralized property scanning
  - New component: `PropertyPicker.ts` with CSS in `styles/property-picker.css`

## [4.3.24] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- Reminder anchor dropdown now uses auto-discovered date properties correctly
- Context menu event registration in TaskListView
- Normalize YAML Date objects in dateAnchorUtils (Obsidian's YAML parser converts bare dates to JS Date objects)

### Changed
- Removed dead `taskTypeValue` from settings type (was unused code)
- Default `identityTypePropertyName` changed to `tnType` (avoids conflicts with other plugins)

### Added
- WSL2 auto-detection for Playwright E2E launcher
- Development/Testing/E2E sections added to README
- Settings cross-link navigation in task properties and shared vault tabs

## [4.3.23] - 2026-02-09

### Added

  - Built-in anchors: due, scheduled, dateCreated, dateModified, completedDate
  - Custom date fields from user-configured properties are automatically discovered
  - Edit Task modal reminder dropdown shows all available date anchors with current values
  - Right-click context menu quick reminders dynamically list all anchors with values
  - Settings > Default Reminders dropdown enumerates all date properties
  - Bulk task creation applies reminders with any anchor type
  - New utility: `dateAnchorUtils.ts` for centralized anchor discovery and resolution

### Changed
- `Reminder.relatedTo` type widened from `"due" | "scheduled"` to `string` for extensibility
- NotificationService uses dynamic anchor resolution instead of hardcoded due/scheduled check
- ReminderModal uses dynamic dropdown instead of hardcoded two-option select
- ReminderContextMenu dynamically iterates all date anchors instead of two hardcoded sections
- TaskContextMenu quick reminders use dynamic anchor discovery
- Settings remindersPropertyCard uses dynamic anchor list

## [4.3.22] - 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Bulk modal UI overhaul**: Complete redesign matching Edit Task modal polish
  - Icon-based action bar for bulk values (due, scheduled, status, priority, reminders)

  - Stackable reminders via ReminderModal (multiple reminders per bulk operation)
  - Unified bulk values across both Generate and Convert modes
  - Inline warning when reminders set without due/scheduled date
  - New BEM-scoped CSS (`styles/bulk-modal.css`)

## [4.3.21] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

  - `personTypeValue`: Value that identifies person notes (default: "person")
  - `groupTypeValue`: Value that identifies group notes (default: "group")
  - `taskTypeValue`: Value that identifies task notes for Bases (default: "task")
  - Allows using custom properties if "type: person" conflicts with other plugins

## [4.3.20] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **NotificationCache**: High-performance caching layer for notification items
  - 45-second TTL on aggregated results
  - In-flight promise deduplication (prevents concurrent duplicate evaluations)
  - Folder→Bases inverted index for O(1) invalidation lookup
  - Bell click is now instant (~1ms cache hit vs ~200-500ms full scan)
- **Per-category reminder behavior settings**: Each time category has configurable behavior
  - Overdue, today, tomorrow, thisWeek, scheduled, queryBased categories
  - Dismiss behaviors: until-restart, snooze-1h/4h/1d, until-data-change, until-complete, permanent
  - Per-category bell toggle (show/hide in status bar count)
  - Per-category toast toggle (show/hide popup notification)
  - Advanced settings section in Settings → Notifications → General
- **Scrollable toast items**: Click "+X more" to enable scroll mode with all items visible
- **Ctrl+hover page preview**: Task titles in toast support Ctrl+hover to show page preview

### Changed
- **Bell shows PENDING only**: Status bar count now shows only unseen items where category has `showInBellCount: true`
- **Smart invalidation**: File changes only re-evaluate bases that monitor the changed folder (not ALL bases)
- **Console log timestamps**: All debug console output now includes ISO timestamps for traceability
- **Settings reorganized**: Notifications section split into General/Task/Base sub-sections
  - Global settings (toast click, status bar click, check interval, show on startup) moved to General
  - Per-category behavior settings in General → "Reminder behavior by category (advanced)"
- **Settings UX clarity**: Improved labels and help text for reminder behavior settings
  - "Bell" → "Show in bell count", "Toast" → "Show popup", "Dismiss:" → "After 'Got it':"
  - Dynamic help text explains what happens when you dismiss (e.g., "Removed from bell for **4 hours**, then returns")
  - Dynamic values highlighted in accent color for visual distinction from template text
  - Category cards with background and accent border for clearer visual grouping
  - Footer explanation updated with clearer bullet-point format

### Fixed
- **Toast click area**: Click handler now includes subtitle text for expand mode (was only handling explicit elements)
- **Constant background activity**: Removed O(n) "evaluate ALL bases" approach on every file change
- **Delayed bell response**: Bell click now returns cached data instantly instead of waiting for full evaluation

### Performance
- Bell click: ~200-500ms → ~1ms (cache hit)
- Periodic check (no changes): Full scan → Instant (cache hit)
- File change in monitored folder: ALL bases evaluated → Only affected bases
- File change elsewhere: ALL bases evaluated → No evaluation

## [4.3.19] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- **Per-device notification preferences**: Each device can override vault-wide notification settings
  - Notification type (in-app, system, both) per device

- **Settings cross-links**: Navigate between Features and Team & Attribution notification sections

### Changed
- **Actionable toasts persist**: Toasts with action buttons no longer auto-dismiss (WCAG 2.2.4 compliance)
- **Toast dismiss button**: Now shows text "Dismiss" instead of icon (better visibility in dark themes)
- **Realistic test notification**: Shows aggregated toast with snooze instead of simple message
- **Shared assignee filter**: NotificationService and VaultWideNotificationService use common filtering logic

### Fixed
- **NotificationService device prefs**: Now reads notification type from per-device preferences instead of vault-wide only
- **"Both" permission request**: System notification permission requested for "both" delivery type

## [4.3.18] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- **UpcomingView 2-row Todoist layout**: Items now display in two rows
  - Row 1: Checkbox + title + assignee avatar stack

- **UpcomingView item spacing**: Increased vertical padding (12px) and row gap (3px) to match Todoist density
- **Base notification avatars**: Now visible alongside the layers icon (previously hidden by if/else)

### Fixed
- **PersonGroupPicker detection**: Case-insensitive key comparison fixes field matching edge cases
- **Ctrl+click in UpcomingView**: Now opens tasks and base notifications in new tabs
- **Creator field rendering**: No longer shows as empty text box; uses PersonGroupPicker like assignee
- **Ghost user fields**: Empty-key fields in settings are skipped instead of rendering blank inputs
- **Edit Task modal spacing**: Added margin between field groups (title/contexts gap)
- **Assignee picker loading**: Resolves shortest wikilinks correctly when loading existing assignees

## [4.3.17] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- **Person avatars**: Circular avatars with initials for person/group display

  - Smart year display: Skips year if same as current year
  - Today/Tomorrow labels: "Feb 3 • Today • Monday"
  - Clean format: "Feb 5 • Wednesday"

### Fixed
- **Configure view toggle not working**: Bases API returns toggle values as strings ("true"/"false"), not booleans. Fixed type checking in `getDateSettings()` to handle both
- **Section header duplication**: "Feb 2 • Today • Monday • Today • Monday" bug fixed by using simple date format in section headers

- **"Edit task" action in collision modal**: Returns to task creation screen instead of cancelling

## [4.3.15] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- **New "zettel-title" filename format**: Combines sortable date ID with readable title
  - Format: `260202abc-My Task Title.md` (zettel ID + dash + title)
  - Short, sortable, readable, and collision-proof

- **Groups system**: Group notes (`type: group`) with nested group resolution
  - `GroupRegistry` discovers groups and resolves members recursively
  - Cycle detection prevents infinite loops (max depth: 10)
  - Settings UI section for group notes folder and tag filter
- **Person preferences**: `PersonNoteService` reads reminder preferences from person note frontmatter
  - Configurable `reminderTime`, `reminderLeadTimes`, `notificationEnabled`
- **Bulk operation types**: Unified `BulkOperationResult` interface for consistent result handling
  - Helper functions: `createEmptyResult`, `mergeResults`, `formatResultNotice`
  - Conversion functions: `fromCreationResult`, `fromConvertResult`
- **Device identity integration**: Creator field auto-populated in bulk task creation and conversion

### Fixed
- **Case-insensitive filename collision on Windows**: `generateUniqueFilename()` now uses case-insensitive comparison to prevent "File already exists" errors when filenames differ only by case (e.g., "Test" vs "test")
- **Folder autocomplete drill-down**: Selecting a folder with subfolders now keeps the dropdown open to show subfolders, instead of requiring manual re-entry

## [4.3.14] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Upcoming View** (`tasknotesUpcoming`): New Todoist-style Bases view type for aggregated task display
  - Time-categorized sections: Overdue, Today, Tomorrow, This Week, This Month, Later, No Due Date
  - Agenda-style date navigation bar with period selectors (Year, Month, Week, 3-Day, Day, List)
  - Arrow navigation (< >) and "Today" quick-jump button
  - Collapsible sections with item counts
  - "Add task" button at bottom of each section (creates task with correct due date)
  - Reschedule action in section headers
- **Base Notification Sync Service**: Real TaskNote files for notification-enabled bases
  - Creates task files with `type: base-notification` for bases with `notify: true`
  - Fully compatible with Bases filtering (sync-to-files approach)
  - Auto-sync on plugin load, periodic checks, and manual command
  - Configurable behavior when base has no matching items
- **Base notification rendering in Upcoming view**:
  - Bell icon indicator for base notification tasks
  - Right-side accent border for visual distinction
  - Item count badge (e.g., "11" with layers icon)
  - Specialized context menu: Open base, Open task, Mark resolved, Reschedule, Snooze
- **Time display** (Todoist-style): Clock icon with formatted time for tasks with time component
- **Date row color coding**: Overdue (red), Today (green), Tomorrow (orange), This Week/Month (accent), Later (muted)

### Fixed
- **Date categorization timezone bug**: Tasks due "today" were incorrectly showing as "overdue" in negative UTC offset timezones. Root cause: `new Date("YYYY-MM-DD")` parses as UTC midnight. Fixed by using `parseDateAsLocal()` for timezone-safe local date parsing.
- **Add task date bug**: Creating task for "Tomorrow" created it on wrong day due to `toISOString()` UTC conversion. Fixed by using local date components directly.
- **Hover jitter on base notification items**: Conflicting CSS hover styles caused layout shifts. Fixed with consistent padding/margin in hover state.

### Changed
- **Overdue display**: Removed redundant "Due" prefix (e.g., "Yesterday" instead of "Due yesterday") since items are already in red Overdue section
- **Add task button indent**: Subtle 4px indent to align with task content (reduced from 26px)
- **Base notification accent**: Changed from bright purple to subtle `--text-accent` color

## [4.3.13] - 2026-01-30

### Changed
- **Opt-in debug logging**: Converted debug console statements to use DebugLog utility for Obsidian plugin guidelines compliance
  - `BasesQueryWatcher.ts`, `bulk-convert-engine.ts`, `BasesViewBase.ts` now use `plugin.debugLog.*`
  - Debug/log/warn messages only output when debug mode enabled (toggle via command)
  - Error messages still always output (allowed per Obsidian guidelines)
  - Logs written to both console and `debug.log` file when enabled

### Fixed
- **E2E cross-platform support**: Improved Obsidian binary detection for Windows/macOS/Linux in Playwright tests
- **E2E port conflict**: Changed remote debugging port from 9222 to 9333 to avoid Chrome conflicts

## [4.3.12] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed
- **What's New page missing versions**: Build script now auto-generates missing release notes from CHANGELOG.md when versions are skipped (e.g., due to CI failures)

### Added
- Release notes gap detection in `generate-release-notes-import.mjs`

## [4.3.11] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **Folder autocomplete** for Default Tasks Folder and Archive Folder settings (Task Storage section)

### Fixed
- CI build failure due to missing device identity service imports in main.ts

## [4.3.10] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **Team Attribution enhancements**:
  - Creator and Assignees cards now include descriptive help text
  - Type dropdown (Text/List) for changing property format
  - Type badge showing current field type in card header
  - Auto-conversion of existing task data when type changes (text↔list)
  - Delete buttons to remove Creator/Assignees fields when not needed
  - Default types documented in overview callout (Creator: text, Assignees: list)

### Fixed
- Duplicate "Add User Field" buttons in Custom User Fields section (empty state + setting)
- Translation key showing literally as label in property settings

### Changed
- Toned down success styling for Team Attribution fields (subtle green border only)
- Assignees field now defaults to "list" type for multiple people
- Clarified notification wording: "everyone using the vault" instead of "the entire team"

## [4.3.9] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **isTask still empty after convert**: Replaced complex conditional logic with simple unconditional approach. Now deletes existing value and sets fresh boolean `true`. No more edge cases.

## [4.3.8] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **isTask empty value bug**: When `isTask:` had no value (YAML null), the convert engine didn't repair it. Now handles `null` in addition to `undefined` and empty string.

## [4.3.7] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **isTask checkbox rendering (dash/prohibition symbol)**: Added auto-repair for files with string `"true"` instead of boolean `true`. Convert mode now detects and fixes type mismatches, ensuring Obsidian Bases renders checkboxes correctly.
- **BasesQueryWatcher "monitoring 0 bases"**: Added debug logging to identify why `.base` files with `notify: true` weren't being monitored. Silent YAML parse errors are now logged.

### Changed
- Convert engine now coerces boolean-like strings (`"yes"`, `"no"`, `"1"`, `"0"`) to proper booleans

## [4.3.6] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **isTask detection bug**: `TaskManager.isTaskFile()` rejected empty `taskPropertyValue` setting, so converted files with `isTask: true` were never recognized as tasks. Guard clause now treats empty value as "property existence check" (any truthy value matches).
- **Task creation with empty propValue**: `TaskService` now defaults to `isTask: true` (boolean) when `taskPropertyValue` setting is empty, matching the convert engine's behavior.

## [4.3.5] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- Compatibility panel in Convert mode showing file type breakdown before conversion
  - Shows ready-to-convert, already-task, and non-markdown file counts
  - Expandable section listing incompatible filenames (max 5, then grouped overflow)
  - Warning banner when >25% of files will be skipped

### Fixed
- "What's New" page now shows fork release notes (was only showing upstream versions)
- Re-converting files with empty `isTask: ""` from buggy v4.3.3 now properly sets `isTask: true`

## [4.3.4] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- Convert mode now skips non-markdown files (e.g., `.xlsx`, `.pdf`, `.png`) instead of timing out on metadata cache
- Pre-check shows non-markdown file count in status message

## [4.3.3] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- `isTask` property now defaults to `true` when `taskPropertyValue` setting is empty (was setting empty string)

## [4.3.2] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- GitHub release workflow now auto-publishes with correct assets (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`)

### Changed
- Bulk Tasking modal UI cleanup: removed redundant description, preview heading, file icons; tightened spacing

## [4.3.1] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- GitHub Actions release workflow for BRAT installation
- Automated releases on version bump

## [4.3.0-fork.1] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- **Bases Query Notifications**: Todoist-style modal triggered by `notify: true` in `.base` files
  - Per-item Open, Complete, Snooze, Dismiss buttons
  - Background watcher evaluates on task updates
- **Bulk Task Generation**: "Bulk tasking" button in Bases toolbar
  - Creates new task files from view results
  - Duplicate detection (wiki-link parsing, URL decode, filename fallback)
  - Skip existing toggle
- **Bulk Convert-to-Task**: Second mode in Bulk Tasking modal
  - Adds task metadata to existing notes in-place
  - Respects `taskIdentificationMethod` setting
  - Optional base-view linking
  - Default mode setting
- **Device-User Identity** (scaffolded): UUID-based device identity for future per-person task targeting
- **Dev tooling**: Test data reset script (`bun run reset`)

### Changed
- Button renamed from "Generate tasks" to "Bulk tasking"
- `.gitignore` updated to include build outputs for BRAT installation
